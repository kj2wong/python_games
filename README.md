Python Games
============

A few interactive games written in Python, through a Python programming course taught on Coursera.org.

To Run:

In each file, there is a commented header. In that header, you will find a link (to Codeskulptor, the online IDE used in the course).
Copy that link to a browser (preferably Chrome, Firefox works too, but not IE)
In the top left hand corner is a play button. Pressing that button will cause the program to start.
Enjoy the games!
